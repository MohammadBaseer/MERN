The software systems they're using have been carefully selected and built from the ground up to work together seamlessly. There are no legacy systems, data, or competing business concerns to manage. Cut to reality. You're a Java developer. The marketing guy tells you that \"corporate\" wants a Flex-based site and you have to deliver it on top of what you already have. Your budget Don't even ask. \"Make it look like the Discovery channel or something.\" Flex on Java assumes you live in the real world not the demo. This unique book shows you how to refactor an existing web application using the server-side you already know. You'll learn to use Flex 3 in concert with Spring, EJB 3, POJOs, JMS, and other standard technologies. Wherever possible, the examples use free or open source software. The authors start with a typical Java web app and show you how to add a rich Flex interface. You also learn how to integrate Flex into your server-side Java via the BlazeDS framework, Adobe's open-source remoting and web messaging technology for Flex. The book shows you how to deploy to not only the web but also to the desktop using the Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR).

    "longDescription": "There's a great deal of wisdom in a crowd, but how do you listen to a thousand people talking at once Identifying the wants, needs, and knowledge of internet users can be like listening to a mob. In the Web 2.0 era, leveraging the collective power of user contributions, interactions, and feedback is the key to market dominance. A new category of powerful programming techniques lets you discover the patterns, inter-relationships, and individual profiles the collective intelligence locked in the data people leave behind as they surf websites, post blogs, and interact with other users. Collective Intelligence in Action is a hands-on guidebook for implementing collective-intelligence concepts using Java. It is the first Java-based book to emphasize the underlying algorithms and technical implementation of vital data gathering and mining techniques like analyzing trends, discovering relationships, and making predictions. It provides a pragmatic approach to personalization by combining content-based analysis with collaborative approaches. This book is for Java developers implementing collective intelligence in real, high-use applications. Following a running example in which you harvest and use information from blogs, you learn to develop software that you can embed in your own applications. The code examples are immediately reusable and give the Java developer a working collective intelligence toolkit. Along the way, you work with, a number of APIs and open-source toolkits including text analysis and search using Lucene, web-crawling using Nutch, and applying machine learning algorithms using WEKA and the Java Data Mining (JDM) standard.",

    "longDescription": "Using Flex, you can create high-quality, effective, and interactive Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) quickly and easily. Flex removes the complexity barrier from RIA development by offering sophisticated tools and a straightforward programming language so you can focus on what you want to do instead of how to do it. And the new features added in Flex 4 give you an even wider range of options! Flex 4 in Action is an easy-to-follow, hands-on Flex tutorial that goes beyond feature coverage and helps you put Flex to work in real day-to-day tasks. You'll quickly master the Flex API and learn to apply the techniques that make your Flex applications stand out from the crowd. The expert authors of Flex 4 in Action have one goal-to help you get down to business with Flex. Fast. Flex 4 in Action filters out the noise and dives into the core topics you need every day. Using numerous easy-to-understand examples, Flex 4 in Action gives you a strong foundation that you can build on as the complexity of your projects increases. Interesting themes, styles, and skins It's in there. Working with databases You got it. Interactive forms and validation You bet. Charting techniques to help you visualize data Bam! And you'll get full coverage of these great Flex 4 upgrades: Next generation Spark components-New buttons, form inputs, navigation controls and other visual components replace the Flex 3 \"Halo\" versions. Spark components are easier to customize, which makes skinning and theme design much faster A new \"network monitor\" allows you to see the data communications between a Flex application and a backend server, which helps when trying to debug applications that are communicating to another system/service Numerous productivity boosting features that speed up the process of creating applications A faster compiler to take your human-written source code and convert it into a machine-readable format Built-in support for unit testing allows you to improve the quality of your software, and reduce the time spent in testing",

It provides a pragmatic approach to personalization by combining content-based analysis with collaborative approaches. This book is for Java developers implementing collective intelligence in real, high-use applications. Following a running example in which you harvest and use information from blogs, you learn to develop software that you can embed in your own applications. The code examples are immediately reusable and give the Java developer a working collective intelligence toolkit. Along the way, you work with, a number of APIs and open-source toolkits including text analysis and search using Lucene, web-crawling using Nutch, and applying machine learning algorithms using WEKA and the Java Data Mining (JDM) standard.",

    "longDescription": "With Flex 3, Adobe has succeeded in developing a framework that offers enormous potential to both web designers and developers. For developers, the Flex framework is more flexible and easy to work with than the Flash, allowing developers to create more complex and better-structured applications. The ability to create database-driven applications gives developers more options and possibilities to work with. For web designers, Flex gives a way to create UIs for dynamic web applications using drag-and-drop components. Flex provides the interactivity that users have come to expect from modern web applications. With Hello! Flex 4, Adobe Flex and Flash experts Adam and Joel show you how to create great looking UIs and write solid and robust applications. Flex applications will be created using Adobe's open source Flex SDK, which is compatible with other popular web development technologies such as PHP and Java. Hello! Flex 4 provides a developer-friendly introduction to Adobe's Flex framework, which is designed to enable users to quickly create Rich Internet Applications. The book is packed with easy-to-understand examples that explain the basics of Flex 4, along with more complex examples that show how to develop basic dynamic web applications. It also covers how to develop data-driven applications with Flex and offers a basic introduction to object-oriented programming and ActionScript 3.0.",
